I want to study {{subject}}, and you have to act as a teacher. I want you to generate a syllabus for me, for studying 
the following topics:
{{syllabus}}
These are the constraints, to follow while generating the cirriculum for me:
{{constraints}}
This is how the output should be
- Replace this with topic 1 name
    - Sub topic 1 Name
    - Sub topic 2 Name
    - Sub topic 3 Name
        - 1
        - 2
        - 3
- Replace this with other topic names
    - Sub topic 1 Name
    - Sub topic 2 Name

And so on...

Adhere strictly to this format. The output should be only markdown and syllabus nothing else.
Give perfect curriculum for learning. Output strictly markdown curriculum.
