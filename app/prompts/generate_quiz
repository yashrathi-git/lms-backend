Let's consider there's a question named "Question" with four choices "option1", "option2", "option3", "option4" and correct option is 3. Give me the output strictly in minified JSON format. I am blindly trusting you with this, I need the qesution, choices and correct answer in json format like this:

{
        "question": "Question",
        "choices": ["option1", "option2", "option3", "option4"],
        "correct_answer": "3"
}
I will directely use your response to do a json.loads(). Give me the output in JSON only and nothing else. Perfect JSON minified.
